## How It Works
1. Geocoding  
Uses OpenStreetMap Nominatim to convert your location into latitude/longitude.

2. Weather Data  
Queries NOAA's Weather API to retrieve the nearest forecast office and current conditions.

3. Radar  
Opens the live NOAA radar viewer centered on the nearest radar station.
